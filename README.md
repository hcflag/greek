Work in progress developing openly licensed, citable, fully analyzed digital editions of texts in ancient Greek.

Technical features:

- the texts are distributed in simple delimited text files
- citations are expressed with CTS URNs
- texts are distributed in two versions:
    - text contents using Unicode code points in form NFC
    - text contents using primarily or exclusively ASCII characters
- the equivalence of the two versions is machine-tested and verified
